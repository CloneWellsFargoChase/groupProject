**Recipe Website**
<br />
-This is a full stack clone of the Chase Bank website. It allows you to create a new account, login, transfer money, and reset your password.
        
**Installing**
<br />
-If you want to install this project just clone it to your machine and then "npm i". 

**Stack**
<br />
-React with Redux, Express, Node, PostgreSQL
<br />

**Front End Highlights**
<br />
-For front end styling we relied mainly on flex and also utalized SCSS. We also used css animations for the dropdown menu on the front page and javascript for the slider on the same page. We also used positioning for the accounts page. <br />
-We mainly used Redux for data flow but we occationally moved data via basic React props. Axios helped us connect to our back end.
<br />

**Back End Highlights**
<br />
-We used customized algorithms on the back end to handle login, transfering money, resetting passwords, creating new users, and viewing account data. We also created middleware to secure our site against repeated requests over a certain number from an IP. Nodemailer was integrated in order to assist with resetting the password and welcoming new users. The database was also indexed in order to speed up the process of responding to get requests for transactions in the future. The site enjoys full CRUD capabilities.
