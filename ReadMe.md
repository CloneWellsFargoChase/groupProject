**Recipe Website**
<br />
-This is a full stack recipe website. It allows you to search for different recipes by cusine, title, or a phrase (all together or each by itself). You can then view the recipe as well as reviews, and add it or remove it from the favorites list. You can view favorites in another tab. Another feature is the kitchen feature. The kitchen allows you to keep track of the items in your fridge and find out what recipes you can make given those items. You can add new items in the same location and the back end keeps track of your purchase history and predicts when you need to buy something again. You can also add new recipes of your own.
        
**Installing**
<br />
-If you want to install this project just clone it to your machine and then "npm i". 

**Stack**
<br />
-AngularJS, Express, PostgreSQL
<br />

**Front End Highlights**
<br />
-The styling framework for the front end combined positioning and flex. I also included some basic css animations for the dropdown menus and mouse overs.
-In Angular I used router to set up the three basic routes. I used one primary service to control the flow of data to three different controllers. The header is continually present through out the site for navigation purposes.
<br />

**Back End Highlights**
<br />
-I used five custom algorithms in the backend. One uses prior consumption data to predict and notify grocery needs. Another suggests recipes based on the items in your kitchen. The third suggests additional ingredients to add to a recipe based on similar recipes. The fourth handled data cleaning while the last minimized api requests.
-The site enjoys full CRUD capabilities and access to an external API.
